This app was designed to work with the Streamlit framework.I have built it in Sublime text and it has several options to choose from: Exploratory Data Analysis,
Visualization, Model Selection and some info about the app and about me.It can be run from the anaconda prompt by changing the directory to the one in which you downloaded this
script,then entering the command: streamlit run app.py, where app is the name you have given this app.Please feel free to give feedback to my app and thank you for taking your time
to try it out ^.^
